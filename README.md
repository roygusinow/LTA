This is a (more) user-friendly version of the Julia codebase described in the paper "Latent Transition Analysis for Longitudinal Studies of Post-Acute Infection Syndromes: A Multinational Investigation of Post-COVID-19 Condition". It contains tools implemented in Julia for simulation, model estimation and visualisation of the modified discrete time, discrete space Hidden Markov Model. Be sure to see the vignnete for usage!

- This also serves as the repository built for federated estimation using DataSHIELD.
